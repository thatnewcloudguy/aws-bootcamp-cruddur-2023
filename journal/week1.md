### Multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build

I implemented the instructions as provided in the Docker [Multi-Stage Build Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)


### Dockerfile best practices

I researched [Dockerfile Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)


### Implementing Health Check

[Dockerfile Health Check](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck)


### Multi-stage building for Dockerfile

[Dockerfile Multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)


### Update to gitpod.yml

I added some lines of code to the gitpod.yml file. This is to ensure that ***npm install*** runs automatically when the workspace is launched.

```
init: |
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/backend-flask
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/frontend-react-js
      npm i
```
