## Homework Challenges

### EventBridge

Using EventBridge, I was able to set up a rule that would send notification via SNS when the rule is met. It was a simple rule (I try not to complicate things) involving CloudWatch. A notification would be sent via SNS when there's a change in the Alarm state.

### AWS Well-Architected Tool

I was able to review the questions from the pillars of the AWS Well-Architectured Tool. The pillars are Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Sustainability, Operational Excellence. This tool helps ensure that projects decision and implememtations are done with best practices. At the end of the review, the tool identifies the risk in your workload prioritized by the level of risk, it then suggests plans to address the issues.
