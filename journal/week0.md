# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Prerequisites

I was able to work on all the required prerequisites as instructyed by the team.

Required Homework

I was able to work on all the required homework, and checked all the checklists as listed on the student portal. I encountered some challenges while working on the homework, but I was able to solve the challenges by searching through relevant videos and documentations.

I created my IAM User on the AWS platform and set up MFA.

I saw the videos on Security and Billing. I was also able to answer and submit the quiz on the Security video. 

Architectural Diagram

I was able to reproduce the architectural design for the project, using Lucid Chart.

Homework Challenges

Using EventBridge, I was able to set up a rule that would send notification via SNS when the rule is met. It was a simple rule (I try not to complicate things) involving CloudWatch. A notification would be sent via SNS when there's a change in the Alarm state.
